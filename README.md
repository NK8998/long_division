### Square Root via Long Division (JavaScript)

This project is an implementation of the **long division method for square root calculation**, written in JavaScript. While modern languages provide built-in math libraries, this exercise focuses on **algorithmic problem-solving and precision handling** without relying on `Math.sqrt()`.

**Key Highlights:**

* Implements the classical long division technique taught in mathematics, adapted into a programmatic process.
* Demonstrates handling of edge cases, iterative approximation, and control over decimal precision.
* Serves as an example of **translating low-level mathematical procedures into code**, reinforcing concepts of loops, state management, and numerical accuracy.

This was built as part of my exploration into algorithm design and implementation “from scratch,” highlighting the ability to rethink core problems in computing without depending solely on prebuilt functions.
